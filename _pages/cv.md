Education
======
* B.S. in Geophysics, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), 2014
* Ph.D in Geophysics, University of Houston, 2020

Research Projects
======
**Seismic response of Nenana basin, central Alaska, from 3D seismic wavefield simulations of local and regional earthquakes**

Geophysical Institute (GI), University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) (Aug. 2021-present)
* Supervisor: Carl Tape
* We have developed a  preliminary model for the Nenana Basin region. With the benefits from high-quality data gathered at recently deployed stations. This region serves as an excellent testing ground for analyzing wave propagation in sedimentary basins. Our comparison of basin amplification effects between observed data and synthetic models reveals that amplification within basins is a complex phenomenon. Distinct resonance modes may be excited at varying frequencies or locations throughout the basin.


**Venuse seismicity estimation and seismometer design under high tempurature and pressure** 

Geophysical Institute (GI), University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) (Aug. 2020-2021)
* Title:Postdoctoral Research Associate                           
* Supervisor: Robert Herrick				  
  *	Development and testing of a Venus-analog seismic events catalog using conventional and machine-learning seismicity detection method. Designed a operating mechanism for the Venus seismometer under development of NASA Glenn Research Center to detect more seismic events with minimum energy consumption. 

**Aerial hyperspectral image processing** 

Geophysical Institute (GI), University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) (Aug. 2020-present)
* Supervisor: Martin Stuefer
  * Developed a automated workflow for aerial hyperspectral image processing collected from fixed-wing airplanes. I have simplified the original mannual processing workflow that needs a 27 pages processing guide to a single Python Jupyter notebook with potential to be applied to parallel computing.

**Tidal-seismic resonance** 

Earth and Atmospheric Science Dept., University of Houston  (Sep. 2015-June 2020)				
* Title: Research Assistant	                           
* Advisor: Yingcai Zheng					 
  * We first proposed a new hypothesis that a “resonance” could exist between tidal forces and normal modes of the solid planets. By numerically modeling the tidal evolution of moons, we found this “resonance” could accelerate falling of the moon to the planet, and we named it “tidal-seismic resonance” (Tian and Zheng, 2020, Planetary and Space Science). 

**3-D viscoelastic and acoustic medium Boundary Element Method modeling** 

Earth and Atmospheric Science Dept., University of Houston  (Sep. 2015-June 2020)				
* Title: Research Assistant	                           
* Advisor: Yingcai Zheng		
  * I developed a Boundary Element Method (BEM) tool “AstroSeis” for 3-D viscoelastic and acoustic medium to simulate seismic wave excitation and propagation in an enclosed domain. It can also handle interfaces such as the free surface, solid-solid boundary and solid-liquid boundary with arbitrary topography. Our BEM code is benchmarked by theoretical solution, Direct Solution Method (DSM) and AxiSem in sample 1-d spherical model. Moreover, BEM code can include arbitrary topography on the interfaces that the other three cannot. This code has been shared to GitHub. It can be easily implemented on either a personal laptop, cluster or GPU. 

**Undergraduate researh**

  * Imaged detailed seismic velocity structure in the Iceland Krafla volcano geothermal field using double difference tomography (tomoDD).
