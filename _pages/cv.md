Research experience
======
Geophysical Institute (GI), University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Aug. 2020-present
* Postdoctoral Research Fellow                           Supervisor: Robert Herrick				  
*	Development and initial testing of a Venus-analog seismic events catalog
We have developed a partnership with NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and the Alaska Earthquake Center (AEC) to conduct research on evaluating the expected level and nature of seismic activity on Venus, constructing catalog of terrestrial analog events and assessing how potential design restrictions affect interpretability. The mid-term result of the project has been presented on the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG).

* Tidal-seismic resonance and orbital evolution of planets and moons
We first proposed a new hypothesis that a “resonance” could exist between tidal forces and normal modes of the solid planets. By numerically modeling the tidal evolution of moons, we found this “resonance” could accelerate falling of the moon to the planet, and we named it “tidal-seismic resonance” (Tian and Zheng, 2020, Planetary and Space Science). 
* Boundary element method for seismic wavefield modeling
I developed a Boundary Element Method (BEM) tool “AstroSeis” for 3-D viscoelastic and acoustic medium to simulate seismic wave excitation and propagation in an enclosed domain. It can also handle interfaces such as the free surface, solid-solid boundary and solid-liquid boundary with arbitrary topography.
Our BEM code is benchmarked by theoretical solution, Direct Solution Method (DSM) and AxiSem in sample 1-d spherical model. Moreover, BEM code can include arbitrary topography on the interfaces that the other three cannot. This code has been shared to GitHub. It can be easily implemented on either a personal laptop, cluster or GPU.
